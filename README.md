Abusive Gym Reminder automatically keeps track of your gym attendance using GPS, and calls you a loser when you miss gym days.

## How it works

* **Find you gym** Use a place picker to find your gym by name or location
* **Choose your gym days** You can change these anytime
* **Get Abused** If you dont go near your gym on a gym day, you'll receive an abusive notification the next morning

**Warning** Abusive Gym Reminder may contain offensive messages. You can adjust the abuse mode in the app.

## FAQ

* **GPS? Will this drain my battery?** No. Geofences use a combination of magic to locate the user without maintaining a persistent gps connection

* **These messages are too abusive/not abusive enough** Try adjusting the abuse level in settings. AGR comes in three abuse levels, from 'passive aggressive' to 'abusive mature'

* **The app didn't register my visit!"** You can try to increase the geofence radius under settings. The default radius is 50 meters. Meanwhile, you can edit your attendance history by clicking on a day in the weekview or the history chart. 

* **What if I live directly on top of my gym?** This app will not work correctly. But at least you have that going for you.
