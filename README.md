Abusive Gym Reminder automatically keeps track of your gym attendance using GPS, and sends you a loser when you miss gym days.

## How it works

* **Find you gym** Use geofences to automatically check if you've been near your gym
* **Choose your gym days** Choose your goals for the week
* **Get Abused** If you dont go to your gym on a given day, you'll receive an abusive message the next morning

**Warning** Abusive Gym Reminder may contain offensive messages. You can adjust the abuse mode in the app.
